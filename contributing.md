# Contribution guide


Preferred workflows for outside contributors:


1. **Open an Issue**: Use the "Submit as GitHub Issue" button on the website. Fill in or edit details as needed. Maintainers will triage.


2. **Create a PR adding a JSON file**: Use the "Create PR" button — this opens GitHub's new-file editor with the JSON prefilled. Commit to a branch and open a PR.


Maintainers: After accepting a contribution via PR or Issue, update `fleets.json` in the repo root (or set up an automated script to merge `contrib/*.json`).
